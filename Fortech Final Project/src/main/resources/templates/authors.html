                BookLender is a subscription-based online rental platform for print books and audiobooks.
                The company offers books and audiobooks across categories such as science, history,
                general knowledge, biographies, inspirational books, fiction & non-fiction and others.
                Users can subscribe to limited and unlimited membership plans to rent books.

                History
                Launched in September 2000, BookLender is the oldest online book rental service.
                Founded by veteran business-men Douglas Ross and Andrew Bilinski,
                BookLender set out to revolutionize the way consumers acquired reading materials online.
                Oprah Magazine said BookLender is the book version of Netflix.
                Originally launched as a paperback book rental service of bestselling paperback fiction books,
                BookLender has expanded into children's books, nonfiction books, and audiobooks. Since 2000,
                BookLender has grown its selection from 25,000 titles to over a quarter of a million titles.

                Location
                Located just outside of Washington, D.C. in tech rich Northern Virginia,
                BookLender is strategically located near one of the country's largest book distribution warehouses
                (Ingram Book Group), and a USPS bulk mail center.

                Giving Back
                BookLender donates overstock titles to Reed Medical Center to support our wounded warriors.
                BookLender also donates books to various libraries.
                Yes, we price compare eTextbooks also. Maybe you waited too long to order your textbooks or maybe you
                just didn't have the money to get them earlier. That's alright, don't beat yourself up about it. If you
                see that it's going to take too long to get your textbooks, then eTextbooks are a great alternative.
                Sure, they tend to cost a little more than renting, but they have some big positives too. Mainly that
                you get eTextbooks as soon as you pay for them. In most cases, eTextbooks are very similar to rental
                textbooks. Just like rental textbooks, they also tend to expire. If you want to keep an eTextbook
                forever, they usually have an option to do so. Keep in mind that a forever eTextbook does tend to be a
                lot more expensive than an eTextbook that expires.
                It's not likely that your textbook rental will come with an access code. In almost all cases textbook
                rentals are textbooks that have been used before. This means that if there was an access code that came
                with the original textbook, then it was likely already used by the original owner or renter of the
                textbook. However, it is very possible that you don't even need the access code. A lot of professors
                don't require them. Therefore it's wise to contact the professor of your class to determine if you need
                to buy one. The good news is that you can buy access codes on the textbook publishers website or on the
                secondary market using our price comparison. Just add the term "access code" after the ISBN or textbook
                title for the textbook access code you need.

                        The e-textbook renting market has a potential for future development. Although being often
                        compared with other rental services of other digital content makers, e-textbooks have quite
                        several unique and awesome features.
